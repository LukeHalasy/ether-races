Unlike other areas, Union County has a nice network of trails and plans to expand them, so we would like to encourage people to get out and move no matter the weather or time of year!</p>\r\n<p><br/>Your call to action for the Stay Active Year Round campaign for the spring is to participate in the #StayActive 5k. The race starts at Mill Creek Park (by the soccer fields) and runs up the Jim Simmons Trail into Mill Valley North and then back over the pedestrian bridge. All proceeds benefit the Union County Health Department and allow us to provide mini-grants to local schools to encourage youth to learn life long health habits like running and walking!</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h4><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Packet Pickup:<br/></strong></span>March 15, 2019<br/>10:00 a.m. - 6:00 p.m.<br/>Union County Health Department <br/>940 London Ave #1100, Marysville, OH 43040</h4>",

Unlike many 12-year olds, achieving his dream was complicated by the battle he was fighting against brain cancer.<br/>A gifted student and promising athlete, Stanley was diagnosed with a brain tumor at age 12. Due to the location of the tumor, surgery to remove it resulted in the onset of learning disabilities as well as paralysis of his right arm and leg, making school more difficult and forever preventing him from participating in the many sports he loved.</p>\r\n<p>Despite these unthinkable obstacles, Stanley persevered toward his dream. Unexpectedly, in 2001 the Edwards family learned that Stanley's tumor had returned. Stanley passed away in January of 2002 at the age of 14. In a tribute to this courageous young man, his family created Stanley's DREAM to continue his legacy.</p>\r\n<p>Stanley's DREAM provides college scholarships to graduating seniors and supports childhood brain cancer research by awarding research grants to hospitals.</p>",

This year's event benefits the Wilmot Cancer Institute's Patient Needs Fund.</p>\r\n<p>About the Wilmot Cancer Institute&rsquo;s Patient Needs Fund: &nbsp;The Patient Needs Fund is a donation-based fund for patients under cancer treatment at the Wilmot Cancer Institute.&nbsp; Assistance can be provided to patients in the form of gift cards to local gas, grocery, and general merchandise stores such as Kwik Fill, Wegmans, and Target.&nbsp; Often patients need money for gas as many are driving from outside or on the outskirts of Monroe County for treatment daily or weekly.&nbsp; Target and Wegmans gift cards are typically used for food or every day needs of patients.&nbsp; The amount provided is based upon the patient&rsquo;s needs; as many patients as possible can be assisted with a donation to this unique fund.&nbsp; This is the power of the Patient Needs Fund; patients are able to focus more on their treatment and fighting cancer, and not on the financial burden that so many of us have.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Come dressed in a costume for an opportunity to win a gift certificate to a local restaurant. And, as always, there is plenty of food and the opportunity to take home some great goodies from the bake sale that is put on annual by the family of Steve Ross, the original recipient of funds from this event.</p>\r\n<p>You must be registered by&nbsp;September 30th to guarantee a T-shirt.&nbsp;Groups/teams welcome! Register your team right here on RunSignUp and your whole group will be acknowledged when we present the check to the Needs Fund.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Pricing:</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Before 11:59 pm on December 31, 2018 - $18.00.</li>\r\n<li>January 1, 2019 through August 31, 2019 - $20.00.</li>\r\n<li>September 1, 2019 through September 30, 2019 - $25.00.</li>\r\n<li>October 1, 2019 through October 11, 2019 - $30.00.</li>\r\n<li>October 12, 2019 through October 17, 2019 - $35.00</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Online registration closes at 11:59 pm on October 17, 2019.

Sign up early and save!</p>\r\n<p>Packet pickup will be on Friday, October 18, 2019, from 10:00 am until 7:00 pm at Medved Running and Walking Outfitters, 3400 Monroe Ave., Rochester, NY 14618</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>ROAD CLOSURES &amp; RACE-DAY PARKING</strong>:&nbsp;&nbsp;ERPD and volunteer road monitors will begin closing the course at&nbsp;8:30 AM, and clear vehicle traffic from the course by&nbsp;8:45. Plan to arrive early.&nbsp;On-site parking at the school fills up quickly, but ample parking is available at East Rochester Town Hall, Lois E. Bird School and Techniplex. &nbsp;Distance from start/finish line is about &frac12; mile. There will be NO PARKING on Woodbine Avenue or Garfield Street on race day.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>JUST FOR&nbsp;WALKERS</strong>:&nbsp;&nbsp;Once you have crossed S. Washington St. on West Elm St., use sidewalks where they exist.&nbsp; Volunteer road monitors will guide you so that motorists can pass safely along the route. &nbsp;Once you hit the home stretch of Garfield Street, you&rsquo;re free to hit the street and enjoy your triumphant march to the Finish Line!</p>\r\n<p><strong>TIPS FOR SPECTATORS</strong>: &nbsp;The race route offers many opportunities to watch your runners coming and going.&nbsp;A popular&nbsp;strategy is to park in the back of the Lois E. Bird School and watch from Madison &amp; East Filbert; then, after the runners pass, walk behind the school/Edmund Lyon Park, cross Main Street toward West Filbert, and catch your runners at West Filbert/Garfield St. turn as they head toward the home stretch.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>POST-RACE PARTY</strong>:&nbsp;Back at the school we'll have a HUGE bake sale, food for participants, food trucks for all, awards ceremony &amp; costume contest.&nbsp; Great family fun! &nbsp;Be sure to share your photos to your social media with #scarebraincancer5K !!</p>\r\n<p><strong>DON'T FORGET TO WEAR YOUR COSTUME!! AND THANK YOU FOR HELPING US SUPPORT THE WILMOT CANCER CENTER PATIENT NEEDS FUND</strong></p>",
